    <BR> Hi and welcome to the home page of Phil Keys, or Phillip Edward Keys as I am known in full. If you think you have reached Phillip McClellan Keys, you're in the wrong place. He's my Dad and while he doesn't have his own home page, he can be reached
    at <a href=mailto:philkeys@olympus.net>philkeys@olympus.net</a>.
    <P>
      <CENTER>For those who might be curious as to how I look (and even if you're not), here I am.</CENTER>

      <BR> I don't have a digital camera at home, so this picture was taken at work. If you're interested, here's a picture of how I sometimes feel after a
      <A HREF="pictures/me-drek.GIF">week of work.</A>
      <P>
        I am married and would also like to put up a picture of my wife Kae, but until I can get access to a scanner or something like that, I'll just have to hold off. She is also threatening to put up pictures of our cats too.
        <P>
          My current area of abode is
          <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/japan/explore/index.html">Osaka, Japan</A>.
          <P>
            If you would like to contact me, here are the addresses.

                <P>
                  I will try to organize my life logically (this is probably the only place that will ever happen) here for those of you who wish to peruse further.

                          <BR> It's often been said that anyone who spends any amount of time in Japan ends up wanting to write about it. Here is my chance to add the background noise.
