<HTML><TITLE>One, Two, Thriee, Four!</TITLE><P><CENTER><H3>Music to Run Your Life By</H3></CENTER><P>My original plan was to put some snippets of songs by artists that I liked here, but considering the slim, but possible chances of legal issues (although they really should pay me for free advertisng), I decided to put in a list of links to some of my favorite music.<P><A HREF="http://www.acns.nwu.edu/eno-l/index.html">Brian Eno</A>:  Not only one of the most brilliant popular musicians around, he has also produced some of the best bands & albums in the buisness, people like U2, David Bowie, & The Talking Heads.  He has also collaborated with a lot of folks lke Robert Fripp, Roxy Music, & John Cale.  The link is to something called "the Unofficial" Brian Eno home page.  Ordered a magnificent CDROM from it (had to send travellers checks to Mexico), but it was a limited offer and I don't know if they're still available.  Still, all homage to the Domed One!<P><A HREF="http://http://nyx10.cs.du.edu:8001:/~damjohns/reggae.html">Reggae</A>:  Jah, rastafari, respect to the Jamaicans.  Although reggae has become popular enough that it is almost a cliche of itself, the clean flowing riddims, deep dark rumbles of dub, and infectious rythyms of dance hall are enough to keep one's spirits up and remembering the finer things in life.  Reggae has also become very popular in Japan; in fact I have one CD which mentions all of the areas in Osaka!</HTML>
