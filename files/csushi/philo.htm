<p><b><span style="background-color: #FFFFCC"><font color="#FF0000">The Philosophy of Challenging Sushi</font></span></b></p>  
<p>First of all, an explanation of the name, &quot;Challenging  
Sushi.&quot;&nbsp; Those of you who may have eaten in a Japanese restaurant in  
the US may have noticed that there is usually a poster on the wall of the  
restaurant showing various types of sushi and their names.&nbsp; Quite often,  
these will refer to sushi which is a little more out of the ordinary such as uni  
(sea urchin) or ikura (salmon eggs) as &quot;challenging.&quot;&nbsp; The idea  
behind Challenging Sushi is to showcase basically the Japanese music that I like  
which tends towards the less known and more unusual bands, so I thought it would  
be appropriate in that much of the music I play may seem a bit strange at first,  
but hopefully will go down well after you've taken that first bite.&nbsp;</p>  

<p>Now for the why.&nbsp; Challenging Sushi is the result of a long relationship with Japan, starting   
with my first trip there in 1982.&nbsp; I     
was an university exchange student in Tokyo, and like most students, I was (and still    
am), a music &quot;head.&quot;&nbsp; Now that I was overseas for the first time    
in my life, and of course, one of the things I looked forward to was finding out    
interesting local music.</p>   

<p>However, in the early '80's, the music scene in Japan was dominated by    
&quot;idols,&quot; girls and boys who major claim to the stage was their looks    
and their projection of the correct persona&nbsp; Basically, it sucked.&nbsp;   
And sucked bad.&nbsp; And seemed to be inescapable.&nbsp; No matter where you  
went, it seemed that somewhere in the background, this inane music was always  
playing.&nbsp; It was ubiquitously horrible.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> 

<p>In the dormitory I stayed in, one of the favorite things   
to do for us foreign students was to gather in the social room, watch &quot;Za  
Besto Ten,&quot; a show which showed the top 10 acts in Japan.&nbsp; We would   
just laugh and laugh at how bad these people were.&nbsp; At one time, for some   
reason the show did a dual broadcast between Tokyo and the US, and one of these   
groups, I believe it was Shibugakitai, showed up in the middle of some suburb in   
New Jersey.&nbsp; Instead of the usual screams of thousands of groupies that   
these guys normally faced in Japan, all there were were some bored looking   
housewives and kids who gave them a perfunctory round of applause.&nbsp; Later,   
the mayor of the town was shown giving the key to the city to a guy called  
Matchi who was number   
1 in Japan at that time, and we all felt he should have been recalled.&nbsp;  
Given all this, I began to think that there were no good musicians in Japan. </p> 

<p>Trying to find more interesting acts, I went to some &quot;live houses&quot;   
that featured rock and roll, but my impression was mainly bands who were doing   
their best to imitate the Rolling Stones.&nbsp; I had already heard the Rolling   
Stones, thought they did a pretty good job of being themselves, and didn't   
really understand why someone was bothering to try and recreate them. </p> 

<p>Still, all was not lost.&nbsp; I had a tape of Yellow Magic Orchestra and I   
thought much of their music was pretty good.&nbsp; A friend of mine then turned   
me on to the music of a lady called Togawa Jun, and then I was brought into a   
world of a Japanese artist who not only created interesting music, but also had  
a unique style all her own.&nbsp; Another friend later took me to see Hara  
Masumi live, and I was immediately hooked.&nbsp; His sound, while reminding me  
of the Talking Heads and Robert Fripp, was also his own.&nbsp; His act was also  
quite unique.&nbsp; I remember the first time I saw him, he and his band were  
sitting on the stage all eating a spaghetti dinner.&nbsp; One by one, each of  
the musicians got up and started playing his instrument and so the show started. </p> 

<p>Fast forward a few years to a different place, Okazaki near Nagoya.&nbsp; I  
had found this weird little coffee shop and live house called <a href="http://www.d1.dion.ne.jp/~folktime/hatiyousya.htm">Hachiyosha</a>.&nbsp;  
The first floor was a small coffee shop and the second floor was for live  
music.&nbsp; It was about the size of 10 tatami mats, and at the most 2  
musicians could play while the audience would sit and listen.&nbsp; Well, listen  
as well as they could. Right next to the shop was the Meitetsu railway line. so  
the sound of passing trains would sometimes drown out the music.&nbsp; Not  
exactly the most conducive environment for quality music.&nbsp; However, the  
strange thing was that all the musicians I heard who played there were very  
talented.&nbsp; With that experience, and friends introducing me to more and  
more interesting musicians, it became apparent that Japanese musicians were just  
as talented and could play a variety of music as anyone else in the world.&nbsp;  
It was just that if they decided to do so, they wouldn't appear anywhere near  
the major music outlets. </p> 

<p>Thus began the search and the collection that you now hear on Challenging  
Sushi.&nbsp; It's a collection of music that hopes to show the wide variety of  
styles and talents that Japanese musicians can muster.&nbsp; Also, one thing 
that I can say is that the quality of the Japanese musicians in the popular 
arena is much better these days then when I first encountered it. </p>
