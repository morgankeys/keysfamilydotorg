<p>Welcome to Challenging Sushi!&nbsp; Challenging Sushi is an audio stream       
focused on (at least what I think) are interesting and innovative Japanese musicians.&nbsp;      
Much of the music here is relatively obscure and genres represented are rock,       
reggae, dub, punk, folk rock, new wave, electronica, folk, and some things that       
just defy classification.&nbsp; If you're interested in the latest Japanese hits from really cute girls     
or boys or rock from people who      
spend more time on their makeup then their guitar licks, then there are many other audio streams that you can listen       
to, and we'll both be happier.&nbsp; However, if you're interested in hearing Japanese musicians    
playing quality       
music in a variety of styles and quite often pushing the boundaries, then take a       
listen!</p>
<p>Fair Warning:&nbsp; Some of the songs broadcast on the stream contain adult      
language, in both English and Japanese (can you believe?)</p>
